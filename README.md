# File Archive

Originally created as an Expo "Snack" we have been slowly working towards a full source code
repository for this React Native (Expo) App. The documentation will be updated as we make 
progress on this project.

The current version of this repo is intended to be used with and use it with [expo cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#expo-cli)).

## Configuration

This project uses Firebase and in order to correctly connect to your Firebase App and Firestore,
you will need to setup a basic project, set the permissions for access, and then configure the app.

### Setup Firebase Project

*TODO*

### Set Permissions for Access

*TODO*

### Configure the app

We have an example of the configuration in the root of the repo called `dotenv.example`. Simply 
copy that file over to the proper configuration file and put your development values in the
file (from the previous **Setup Firebase Project** step). Never commit these values to your
repo or any publicly available location as they need to remain private and secure.

```
  cp dotenv.example .env
```
